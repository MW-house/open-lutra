"""ROS2 infrastructure (CLI execution, message conversion, topic monitor node, thread management).

Public API:
    ROS2Command / ROS2CommandError: ROS2 CLI wrapper
    RecordProcess: Control over a recording process started with --start-paused
    QoSOverrideFile: Temporary file management for QoS override YAML

Note: TopicMonitorThread / TopicMonitorNode depend on rclpy and are not
included in the barrel. Import them directly from their call sites (main.py).
